# LAJC-expungement

Project to help the Legal Aid and Justice Center with analysis to support efforts to expand criminal record expungement reform in Virginia.

For more details, see the [project page](https://www.codeforcville.org/lajc-expungement) on the Code for Charlottesville website. 

## Getting Started

Currently, data for this project is stored in a PostGreSQL DB only accessible from Code for Charlottesville's JupyterHub deployment, avaliable at tljh.codeforcville.org. 

If you do not yet have login access for JupyterHub, but you would like to get connected and help out, please reach out via the questions box at the bottom of the above project page. 

For examples of connecting to the database, see [the `/templates` folder](templates). 

- Example of connecting from a Python notebook: [templates/db_example_python.ipynb](templates/db_example_python.ipynb)

## About the Data

Data for this project comes originally from http://virginiacourtdata.org/, but has been processed and loaded into the main table `expunge`, which has ~9M records and about ~3M unique `person_id`'s. Each `person_id` represents an anonymized individual. 

Smaller samples of this data are available in the following tables: 
- `data_1k_sample`
- `data_10k_sample`
- `data_100k_sample`

These tables have been constructed such that they contain **all** records for any given `person_id` that they contain, so that they never contain a subset of the records related to a given ID.
